# baseball-player-statfinder
Python GUI with player search for season statistics (data from baseball-reference.com)

1. Search a player in the search bar (must have played in 2023 -- will work to incorporate career statistics)
2. The application will find their baseball-reference ID and positions
3. Relevant statistics will be displayed, including recent game logs, summary statistics for recent periods of time, and overall season statistics
4. Both hitting and pitching statistics can be displayed at the same time (Ohtani)
